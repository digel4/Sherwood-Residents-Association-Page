    content: `Results of Survey 14 – 21 May 2020

    1.         Introduction
    
    The results of the AGM on-line survey are shown below. We are most grateful to the 50 households which took part; the very positive responses provide the Committee with the necessary authority to go forward confidently into 2020/2021. This document will serve as the minutes of the 2020 virtual AGM.
    
    2.         Survey Results

    The accounts for 2019/2020 have therefore been approved and the road fee of £150 per household agreed. Invoices for the road fee are being issued on 1st June and payment should be made within 30 days of receipt. Barrier keys may be disabled for non-payment after one reminder, but prompt payment is requested. The Committee and Officers are duly elected.
    
    3.         Questions
    
    To answer the five questions received:
    
        Accessing cable services will be a matter for individual households after the Openreach works have been completed. It is hoped that the company will start again in early June.
        The contractor has been closed during the Covid crisis, but we hope that the large potholes at the foot of Private Road will be repaired by July.
        Interest on the deposit account accrues annually but was not added when the accounts were prepared for the AGM. The Skipton Building Society gives a competitive rate of interest.
        The membership fee will, in future, include an up-to £5 subscription for the annual social event.
    
    4.         Conclusion
    
    The response to our unusual AGM was very satisfying and we thank those who took part. The newly elected Committee now have a clear mandate to act on behalf of the residents for the next twelve months. Whether or not we will be able to meet again in person remains to be seen, but the church hall will be booked for 2021 and you are reminded that we have pencilled in the date of Saturday 5 September 2020 for a street party.
    
    I thank all members of the Committee for their help, work and advice during 2019/2020, in particular the outgoing Secretary, Stephen Morris, and the Membership and Social Media Group who have helped to alleviate hardship and provided support during this emergency.
    
    Finally, I hope that we will all come through these difficult times safely so that we may once again fully enjoy the many benefits of our community.
