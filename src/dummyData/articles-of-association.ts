  Rules of the Private Road Members Association – 2019 Final
  
  Name
  
      The name of the Association is Private Road and Victoria Crescent Members Association (the Association, or Private Road Members Association – PRMA).
  
  Membership Rights and Obligations
  
  2.1       Subject to rule 2.2 and 2.3, membership is open to (but only to) owner-occupiers of dwellings and other properties situated in or gaining access from Private Road from the junction with Gordon Rise to Mansfield Road and Victoria Crescent (“the roads”) who have paid the appropriate subscription. “Owner-occupiers” includes lessees with leases of at least one year. The land constituting the roads is shown in the annexed plan.
  
  2.2       If, in relation to a given dwelling, there is more than one member, those members shall be entitled to only one vote between them. They shall not pay more than one subscription between them. If the Association is wound up, they shall be entitled to only one share of its property between them. If a member owns more than one property in the PRMA curtilage, a membership fee will be due for each properties owned and the member will only be entitled to the benefits of membership if all fees owing are paid.
  
  2.3       A member may resign by giving written notice to the Committee, and shall be deemed to have resigned if he or she ceases to be eligible for membership, or if his or her subscription is unpaid for two months after it is due, and in that event, shall not be entitled to re-join the Association until the arrears are paid. The subscription is due within 30 days of the AGM minutes or an invoice for the membership fee being distributed to members, whichever comes sooner. One reminder will be sent. Once resigned the member will have any current barrier keys disabled. If allowed to re-join on the payment of any arrears of membership fees, the Executive Committee will arrange the reinstatement of these barrier keys at their convenience.
  
  Objects of the Association
  
  3.1       The object of the Association is to manage the road environment on behalf of the members.
  
  3.2       In particular, the Association shall:
  
  (a)        Maintain the roads in the interests of safety and amenity, including any verges and any additional land, trees, security equipment and other structures which form part of the road, including the barrier;
  
  (b)        Protect the amenity and character of the roads;
  
  (c)        Maintain public liability insurance in relation to the Association’s activities;
  
  (d)        Resist encroachment and the acquisition by use of public and private rights over the roads;
  
  (e)        Deal with the reasonable requests made by a local authority, police authority and any other person or body with an interest in the road(s);
  
  (f)        Act as the street authority in accordance with the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991;
  
  (g)        Subject to rule 7, grant rights of way and other rights over the roads;
  
  Subscriptions
  
  4.1       Subject to the following provisions of this rule, members of the Association shall pay a subscription by 1st June of each year. The financial year of the Association will run from 1st April to 31st March each year.
  
  4.2       The amount of the subscription shall be fixed each year by the Committee and shall be subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting (AGM). In the first year, and in any subsequent year in which the subscription is increased by more than 10%, rule 7 shall apply. If, after the first year, the subscription is not approved by the AGM, the amount payable shall be the amount payable for the previous year. A discount may be offered to members for early payment by a date agreed at the AGM. Any member joining part way through a financial year will, at the discretion of the Executive Committee, be entitled to a pro-rata reduction in the membership fee payable. Should the new member ‘inherit’ the payment of the leaving member, no further subscription for that membership year will be due. However, if they do not ‘inherit’ any barrier keys issued to the former member there will be a £25 fee for each key required. There is no right to a refund of the subscription fee should a member leave part way through a year as the fee attaches to the property within the PRMA area.
  
  4.3       In fixing the subscription, the Committee shall have regard to the need to accumulate funds for major work such as the resurfacing of the road and replacing the barrier.
  
  4.4       Payment of the subscription will entitle each member to be supplied with two keys to access the barrier on Private Road. These will only be supplied once. Keys should be passed to any subsequent owners of the property. Duplicate and keys will be supplied at the discretion of the Committee and at a reasonable charge to be agreed by them.
  
  The Committee
  
  5.1       The Committee shall consist of a Chairman, a Secretary, a Treasurer and at least one other member, chosen from the membership of the Association. The Committee may appoint from within its membership any other officers as it sees fit, to be approved at the subsequent AGM of the Association.
  
  This may include, but not exclusively, the chair of the committee and officers to be responsible for roads maintenance, barrier maintenance, website maintenance, neighbourhood watch and social committee.
  
  5.2       The members of the Committee shall be proposed, seconded and elected by vote at the AGM. Subject to rule 5.3, they shall hold office until the next AGM, when they shall be eligible for re-election.
  
  5.3       A member of the Committee may resign by giving written notice to the Committee. The ensuing vacancy may be filled by the Committee, and any member so appointed shall hold office until the next AGM, when he or she shall be eligible for election.
