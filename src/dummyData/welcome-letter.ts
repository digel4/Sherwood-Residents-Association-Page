Private Road Members Association – Welcome Letter

Welcome to our community.

The Private Road Members Association (which also covers Victoria Crescent, Fairlawn Place and Yew Close) exists to help members by providing a safe, clean road infrastructure kept in good repair. This not only helps all members to come and go without worry, it also makes a contribution to maintaining the value of each and every property in the community.

The Benefits of Membership

For payment of an annual subscription, agreed each year by the members themselves at the Annual General Meeting, the Association helps fully paid up members by:

    Maintaining the surface of the roads and pavements of Private Road and Victoria Crescent.
    Maintaining an insurance policy to cover members for any claim (up to £2M) for damage or injury suffered by people using their part of the pavement or road.
    Sweeping the streets of leaves and other debris and cleaning the drains regularly each year.
    Maintaining the barrier at the top end of Private Road to prevent vehicles using the road as a cut through, thus keeping the road quieter and safer. Association membership includes two keys per household; additional keys cost £25. Lost keys are charged at £25 to replace and the serial number of the lost key must be given before the replacement is issued. Members selling their houses should hand their keys to the new owner and explain the need to keep subscriptions up-to-date. The Barrier Secretary deals with all matters relating to the Barrier.
    Arranging a local Neighbourhood Watch organisation which is distributed in groups of houses, each with a co-ordinator.
    Dealing with local government departments and utility companies on road matters.

Things the Association does not do

    Tree Preservation Orders: Private Road and Victoria Crescent are within a conservation area. Many Tree Preservation Orders exist and all tree works are controlled by the City Council (Cutting of shrubs and hedges does not require planning consent).
    Planning Applications: These may be viewed on-line at the City Council’s web site nottinghamcity.gov.uk. The Association does not get involved in planning or neighbourhood disputes.
    Streetlights: If members observe any malfunctioning streetlights, please notify the City Council through their web site using the unique identity number on each post.

Please also note that the Committee has no powers to enforce or prohibit any actions by other members. They cannot act as arbitrators in disputes or deal with complaints between neighbours about cars, children, dogs, cats, bonfires or other similar matters. Consideration, tolerance and good-neighbourliness will ensure a harmonious community.

What you can do (if you live in the Association area)

First and most important, please join the Association and take advantage of the benefits it brings by contacting the Honorary Secretary. (details below).

Attend our AGM. Members are given ample notice of the meeting and all are welcome. Committee members are willing to discuss road matters with residents in advance of the meeting.

Take part in the social side. There is a Social Committee that facilitates group activities.

Please keep any overhanging trees and shrubs on your property trimmed back as it helps people using the pavement prevents the street lighting from being obscured thereby making it safer for all.
